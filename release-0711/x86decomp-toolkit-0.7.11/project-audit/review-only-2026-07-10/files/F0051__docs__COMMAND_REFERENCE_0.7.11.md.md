# Per-file audit: `docs/COMMAND_REFERENCE_0.7.11.md`

## A. File Identity

- **Inventory ID:** `F0051`
- **Relative path:** `docs/COMMAND_REFERENCE_0.7.11.md`
- **SHA-256:** `2ce27d17ff8261b9e25a5f15905813352ec68f8c2d28d4ebff4c991de47a68df`
- **File size:** 571 bytes
- **Language/format:** Markdown
- **Classification:** Documentation
- **Apparent responsibility:** Documentation centered on 'Command reference — 0.7.11'.
- **Provenance:** First-party or repository-maintained text
- **Review applicability:** Complete-content text/source review
- **Related files / static consumers:** No direct relationship established beyond directory and manifest context.
- **Key imports/dependencies:** None or not applicable.

## B. Functional Summary

Documentation centered on 'Command reference — 0.7.11'. Principal sections: Command reference — 0.7.11; Plan-only reconstruction routes.

- **Inputs:** The file itself is consumed as repository content, configuration, documentation, evidence, or test data.
- **Outputs:** Format-specific content for readers, build tools, tests, or package consumers.
- **Side effects / external interactions:** 0 scanner-identified relevant call(s); see Section H for the bounded interpretation.
- **Verified versus inferred:** File bytes, structure, hashes, syntax/format validity, symbols, and logged executions are verified. Purpose statements not established by execution are labeled apparent or inferred.

## C. Correctness Review

Local Markdown-link resolution found 0 broken target(s).

Boundary conditions, malformed input, error propagation, resource cleanup, path handling, encoding, integer/size limits, and partial-operation behavior were assessed where applicable. Findings are listed in Section L; where no finding is listed, the audit did not establish a defect rather than proving none exists.

## D. Documentation and Docstring Review

2 Markdown heading(s) structure the document; local targets were checked repository-wide.

Documentation was judged proportionally: public/non-obvious behavior requires specific contracts, while trivial fixtures and data files do not require artificial prose.

## E. Code Quality and Maintainability

1 line(s) exceed 140 characters; this is a maintainability signal, not by itself a defect.

Broad exception handlers recorded by the scanner: 0. Global/nonlocal declarations: 0. Pass statements: 0. Each was treated as a review lead, not automatically as a defect.

## F. Potential AI-Generated-Code Indicators

No file-specific AI-like quality indicator was raised. The audit makes no authorship attribution.

No claim about authorship is made without provenance evidence. Alternative explanations include manual boilerplate, generated consistency work, compatibility layers, or repeated domain contracts.

## G. Optimization and Performance

No confirmed performance problem was established for this file. Optimization should be driven by profiling or demonstrated scale limits.

Confirmed performance defects require measured impact; no micro-optimization recommendation is made solely from line count or syntax shape.

## H. Security and Robustness

No call matched the targeted process/network/database/file-write risk scanner; this is not a proof of security.

Targeted checks included subprocess shell use, path/archive handling, database calls, network calls, deserialization-adjacent behavior, file writes, resource limits, and malformed-input behavior where relevant. Suspicious binaries were not executed.

## I. Testing Review

No executable file-specific test relationship applies or was established; repository-wide checks are recorded in RUN_LOG.md.

The exact non-duplicated inventory executed 258 tests in 86 reconciled partitions with zero failures, errors, or skips. The packaged duplicate self-test tree executed separately with 21 passes. A passing suite does not establish exhaustive semantic correctness.

## J. Missing Elements

Remediation and verification work is defined by: DOC-002.

## K. Redundancy and Consolidation Opportunities

No exact normalized-function duplicate involving this file was identified by the AST scan.

## L. File-Level Findings

| Finding ID | Severity | Confidence | Symbol or line range | Summary | Evidence | Impact | Recommendation | Verification status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DOC-002 | Medium | Verified | 166 root commands, 405 parser nodes, 239 canonical routes | Detailed command documentation covers only a small fraction of the live command surface | Runtime parser introspection found help text for all 405 parser nodes. Cross-checking every command and route against Markdown code blocks and prose found explicit examples for 23/166 root commands, mentions for 31/405 parser nodes, and examples for 7/239 canonical routes. | New users must infer workflows from --help and source; safety, output, and error contracts are not consistently explained outside the executable. | Generate or maintain a full command reference from parser metadata, augmented with human-authored examples, outputs, error behavior, and safety notes. | Open |

## M. File-Level Verdict

- **Overall quality:** Material issue(s) require remediation.
- **Documentation quality:** See DOC-001/DOC-002 where applicable.
- **Correctness confidence:** Moderate; complete static review plus repository tests, without exhaustive state-space proof.
- **Maintainability assessment:** No file-specific maintainability finding beyond cross-repository observations.
- **Test confidence:** No executable file-specific test relationship applies or was established; repository-wide checks are recorded in RUN_LOG.md.
- **Security assessment:** No unqualified security guarantee; file-specific risk evidence is described above.
- **Recommended priority:** Medium
- **Open questions:** Re-run the command-documentation matrix and manually execute every published example in a disposable workspace.
- **Related follow-up:** DOC-002
- **Final audit status:** **Audited — complete**
