# Per-file audit: `DOCSTRING_AUDIT_0.7.11.json`

## A. File Identity

- **Inventory ID:** `F0009`
- **Relative path:** `DOCSTRING_AUDIT_0.7.11.json`
- **SHA-256:** `f57db971aec207989637aaa0e5a7f6e7cd11400f4a5cbdc849645d17cd5f4cd0`
- **File size:** 24191 bytes
- **Language/format:** JSON
- **Classification:** Generated verification artifact
- **Apparent responsibility:** Structured repository data with top-level keys: audited_file_count, audited_files_sha256, generated_at, missing_docstrings, passed, python_docstring_coverage, quality_checks, release.
- **Provenance:** First-party or repository-maintained text
- **Review applicability:** Complete-content text/source review
- **Related files / static consumers:** No direct relationship established beyond directory and manifest context.
- **Key imports/dependencies:** None or not applicable.

## B. Functional Summary

Structured repository data with top-level keys: audited_file_count, audited_files_sha256, generated_at, missing_docstrings, passed, python_docstring_coverage, quality_checks, release. JSON parsing was verified; top-level type is dict.

- **Inputs:** The file itself is consumed as repository content, configuration, documentation, evidence, or test data.
- **Outputs:** Format-specific content for readers, build tools, tests, or package consumers.
- **Side effects / external interactions:** 0 scanner-identified relevant call(s); see Section H for the bounded interpretation.
- **Verified versus inferred:** File bytes, structure, hashes, syntax/format validity, symbols, and logged executions are verified. Purpose statements not established by execution are labeled apparent or inferred.

## C. Correctness Review

The complete JSON document parsed successfully.

Boundary conditions, malformed input, error propagation, resource cleanup, path handling, encoding, integer/size limits, and partial-operation behavior were assessed where applicable. Findings are listed in Section L; where no finding is listed, the audit did not establish a defect rather than proving none exists.

## D. Documentation and Docstring Review

Documentation expectations were assessed proportionally to the file type; no large docstring requirement was imposed on data or binary fixtures.

Documentation was judged proportionally: public/non-obvious behavior requires specific contracts, while trivial fixtures and data files do not require artificial prose.

## E. Code Quality and Maintainability

6 line(s) exceed 140 characters; this is a maintainability signal, not by itself a defect.

Broad exception handlers recorded by the scanner: 0. Global/nonlocal declarations: 0. Pass statements: 0. Each was treated as a review lead, not automatically as a defect.

## F. Potential AI-Generated-Code Indicators

No file-specific AI-like quality indicator was raised. The audit makes no authorship attribution.

No claim about authorship is made without provenance evidence. Alternative explanations include manual boilerplate, generated consistency work, compatibility layers, or repeated domain contracts.

## G. Optimization and Performance

No confirmed performance problem was established for this file. Optimization should be driven by profiling or demonstrated scale limits.

Confirmed performance defects require measured impact; no micro-optimization recommendation is made solely from line count or syntax shape.

## H. Security and Robustness

No call matched the targeted process/network/database/file-write risk scanner; this is not a proof of security.

Targeted checks included subprocess shell use, path/archive handling, database calls, network calls, deserialization-adjacent behavior, file writes, resource limits, and malformed-input behavior where relevant. Suspicious binaries were not executed.

## I. Testing Review

No executable file-specific test relationship applies or was established; repository-wide checks are recorded in RUN_LOG.md.

The exact non-duplicated inventory executed 258 tests in 86 reconciled partitions with zero failures, errors, or skips. The packaged duplicate self-test tree executed separately with 21 passes. A passing suite does not establish exhaustive semantic correctness.

## J. Missing Elements

Remediation and verification work is defined by: REL-001, DOC-001.

## K. Redundancy and Consolidation Opportunities

No exact normalized-function duplicate involving this file was identified by the AST scan.

## L. File-Level Findings

| Finding ID | Severity | Confidence | Symbol or line range | Summary | Evidence | Impact | Recommendation | Verification status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| REL-001 | High | Verified | Makefile verify/docstrings/verify-hashes; audit-docstrings.main; source_hashes.verify_all | Documented verification sequence rewrites sealed reports before hash verification | Makefile line 3 orders docstrings before verify-hashes. scripts/audit-docstrings.py lines 85-86 generate a current timestamp and lines 138-143 overwrite the two root reports by default. A disposable-clone replay changed both report hashes; the immediately following source_hashes.py verify returned exit 2 with exactly those two hash mismatches. | The documented release gate cannot complete against an otherwise pristine release without an intentional manifest regeneration. | Add a check-only mode that writes to a temporary location or compares generated content while excluding volatile timestamps; make verify should use that mode. Keep report regeneration as an explicit release action. | Open |
| DOC-001 | Medium | Verified | 364 modules, classes, functions, and methods listed in evidence/generic-docstrings.json | Docstring quality gate passes 364 generic low-information docstrings | A full AST scan inspected 1,853 documented symbols and identified 364 (19.6%) matching five generic forms: 231 “Perform the … operation”, 60 module-level “Provide the current runtime implementation …”, 43 generic constructor statements, 28 “Represent … data and behavior”, and 2 “Run the requested operation”. | API readers receive little information about contracts, side effects, failure modes, or domain purpose; the release gate overstates documentation quality. | Replace generic docstrings with behavior-specific contracts and expand the quality gate using an allowlisted semantic-pattern policy plus reviewable exceptions. | Open |

## M. File-Level Verdict

- **Overall quality:** Material issue(s) require remediation.
- **Documentation quality:** See DOC-001/DOC-002 where applicable.
- **Correctness confidence:** Reduced by an open verified finding.
- **Maintainability assessment:** No file-specific maintainability finding beyond cross-repository observations.
- **Test confidence:** No executable file-specific test relationship applies or was established; repository-wide checks are recorded in RUN_LOG.md.
- **Security assessment:** No unqualified security guarantee; file-specific risk evidence is described above.
- **Recommended priority:** High
- **Open questions:** After remediation, run make verify in a fresh extracted archive and prove all original file hashes remain unchanged.; Repeat the full AST scan and manually sample each pattern family after remediation.
- **Related follow-up:** REL-001, DOC-001
- **Final audit status:** **Audited — complete**
