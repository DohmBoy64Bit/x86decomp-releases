## B. Functional Summary

Historical human-readable audit evidence or per-file review. Principal sections: Grouped audit — root analysis/validation modules (B06g-analysis); abi.py (260) — Explicit x86 ABI contracts + bounded static compatibility checks; angr_backend.py (619) — Optional angr comparative symbolic-execution backend; disassembly.py (282) — Capstone-backed x86/x86-64 decode + normalization; dynamic.py (487) — Bounded differential execution using Unicorn; symbolic.py (986) — Bounded symbolic equivalence for small pure leaf functions; diffing.py (79) — Exact byte comparison + similarity reporting; exe_diff.py (195) — PE-function vs COFF-symbol comparison (matching mode).

- **Inputs:** The file itself is consumed as repository content, configuration, documentation, evidence, or test data.
- **Outputs:** Format-specific content for readers, build tools, tests, or package consumers.
- **Side effects / external interactions:** 0 scanner-identified relevant call(s); see Section H for the bounded interpretation.
- **Verified versus inferred:** File bytes, structure, hashes, syntax/format validity, symbols, and logged executions are verified. Purpose statements not established by execution are labeled apparent or inferred.

## C. Correctness Review

Local Markdown-link resolution found 0 broken target(s).

Boundary conditions, malformed input, error propagation, resource cleanup, path handling, encoding, integer/size limits, and partial-operation behavior were assessed where applicable. Findings are listed in Section L; where no finding is listed, the audit did not establish a defect rather than proving none exists.

## D. Documentation and Docstring Review

19 Markdown heading(s) structure the document; local targets were checked repository-wide.

Documentation was judged proportionally: public/non-obvious behavior requires specific contracts, while trivial fixtures and data files do not require artificial prose.

## E. Code Quality and Maintainability

15 line(s) exceed 140 characters; this is a maintainability signal, not by itself a defect.

Broad exception handlers recorded by the scanner: 0. Global/nonlocal declarations: 0. Pass statements: 0. Each was treated as a review lead, not automatically as a defect.

## F. Potential AI-Generated-Code Indicators

No file-specific AI-like quality indicator was raised. The audit makes no authorship attribution.

No claim about authorship is made without provenance evidence. Alternative explanations include manual boilerplate, generated consistency work, compatibility layers, or repeated domain contracts.

## G. Optimization and Performance

No confirmed performance problem was established for this file. Optimization should be driven by profiling or demonstrated scale limits.

Confirmed performance defects require measured impact; no micro-optimization recommendation is made solely from line count or syntax shape.

## H. Security and Robustness

No call matched the targeted process/network/database/file-write risk scanner; this is not a proof of security.

Targeted checks included subprocess shell use, path/archive handling, database calls, network calls, deserialization-adjacent behavior, file writes, resource limits, and malformed-input behavior where relevant. Suspicious binaries were not executed.

## I. Testing Review

No executable file-specific test relationship applies or was established; repository-wide checks are recorded in RUN_LOG.md.

The exact non-duplicated inventory executed 258 tests in 86 reconciled partitions with zero failures, errors, or skips. The packaged duplicate self-test tree executed separately with 21 passes. A passing suite does not establish exhaustive semantic correctness.

## J. Missing Elements

No addition was recommended solely to increase complexity. Any unverified behavior is stated in the testing and verdict sections.

## K. Redundancy and Consolidation Opportunities

No exact normalized-function duplicate involving this file was identified by the AST scan.

## L. File-Level Findings

| Finding ID | Severity | Confidence | Symbol or line range | Summary | Evidence | Impact | Recommendation | Verification status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | — | No file-specific finding was raised. | Complete-content and cross-file checks found no issue meeting the findings threshold. | — | — | Verified review status only; absence of a finding is not proof of defect absence. |

## M. File-Level Verdict

- **Overall quality:** No material file-specific issue was verified.
- **Documentation quality:** Proportionate to file type, subject to repository-wide documentation findings.
- **Correctness confidence:** Moderate; complete static review plus repository tests, without exhaustive state-space proof.
- **Maintainability assessment:** No file-specific maintainability finding beyond cross-repository observations.
- **Test confidence:** No executable file-specific test relationship applies or was established; repository-wide checks are recorded in RUN_LOG.md.
- **Security assessment:** No unqualified security guarantee; file-specific risk evidence is described above.
- **Recommended priority:** Routine
- **Open questions:** None specific; untested behavior remains subject to normal verification.
- **Related follow-up:** Cross-file architecture, documentation, and duplication reports.
- **Final audit status:** **Audited — complete**
